ratmunk is a little metroidvania im working on. at least thats what i think this project is going to be.

you play as a rat named ratmunk :>

i'm making this project for [siege](https://siege.hackclub.com), an event hosted by hackclub. my plan is to hopefully work on it for several of the ten weeks, slowly building out the world and mechanics.
