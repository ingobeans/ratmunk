ratmunk is a little metroidvania im working on. at least thats what i think this project is going to be.

you play as a rat named ratmunk :>

i'm making this project for [siege](https://siege.hackclub.com), an event hosted by hackclub. my plan is to hopefully work on it for several of the ten weeks, slowly building out the world and mechanics.

the project is being made in godot, and its my first time using this engine. 
ive made a couple of games before, but only in rust with macroquad, so this is mostly new to me, but i think its going fine :)
